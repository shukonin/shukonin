# About Me
Hi! I'm Fernando and I'm actually becoming a fullstack web developer. I started this journey by January 2020 and has been one of the most beautiful and hard projects I had ever started.

## Languages 📚

## Communities 🤝
- You can find me in Discord as @Fernando Canas and in different tech communities as Codecademy, Reactiflux, and The Odin Project.
- Also in every social media as @shukonin.

## Why shukonin?
I chose this username not only in GitHub but in all of my social media because when I started learning to code, I wanted this journey to be a place where I could get in deep, study hard the roots of what I would learn and eventually become a master in this technology field and do it for myself, not for only for a job but for the pure joy of it. Shukonin, is a conjunction of two japanesse words that are related with this: 'shokunin' which means to be a master, and 'ronin' who was a samurai who has no longer a master.
